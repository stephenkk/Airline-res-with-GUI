# Airline-res-with-GUI
Updated airline res system with GUI

This is the most recent version of the simple Airline reservation System. It will present the user at a check-in kiosk with an option
to reserve in first class or coach. If the preferred class of service is not available it will allow them to reserve in the alternate.

If the user chooses not to reserve the alternate class of service, a message will inform the user that the next flight departs in 3 hours.

If the flight is full a meesage will inform the user that the next flight departs in 3 hours.

To run the program: download the zip file from Github and unzip. If you unzip from Windows file manager, you may need to move the 
Airline-res folder out of the Downloads folder to another path (perhaps C:\) in order to compile and run.
